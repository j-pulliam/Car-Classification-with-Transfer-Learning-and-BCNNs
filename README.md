# Fine-Grained_Car_Make_and_Model_Classification_with_Transfer_Learning_and_BCNNs
In this project we explore fine-grained car make and model classification on the Stanford Cars Data Set. We first experiment with fine-tuning some of the more famous CNN architectures such as VGG, Resnet, and Densenet. After doing this analysis we build various structured ensembles of these fine-tuned models and analyze how they are able to support each other during classification. Finally we explore the concept of bilinear convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) which take into consideration not only spatial locality within images but also feature location.
